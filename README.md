# Carbon Frontend

## Introduction

Welcome to the carbon-calculator frontend repository! This project aims to provide a frontend interface for a carbon calculator tool. It helps users estimate their carbon footprint and take actions to reduce it.

Before getting started, make sure you have Python and pyenv installed on your system. We recommend creating a Python virtual environment named "carbon_front_streamlit" using pyenv to manage dependencies cleanly.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd carbon-frontend
```

2. Create a Python virtual environment using pyenv:
```bash
pyenv virtualenv carbon_front_streamlit
pyenv activate carbon_front_streamlit
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pyenv virtualenv carbon_front_streamlit
pyenv activate carbon_front_streamlit
```

## Run the project
To start the project, run the following command:
```bash
make start
```
This command will initiate the Streamlit application and you should be able to access it via your web browser.

If you need to update the project dependencies and then run the Streamlit application, you can use the following command:

```bash
make update_and_run
```
